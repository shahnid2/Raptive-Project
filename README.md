# Raptive-Project

**Key Features**
Data cleaning and preparation
Visualization of relationships between metrics
Correlation analysis between "time on page" and "revenue"
Histograms and scatter plots for data exploration

**Technologies Used**
Python
Pandas (for data manipulation)
Matplotlib (for visualization)
Seaborn (for statistical visualizations)
Google Colab (as the development environment)

**How to Use**
Open the Jupyter notebook (raptive.ipynb) in Google Colab
Run each cell sequentially to:
Import necessary libraries
Load and inspect the dataset
Clean and prepare the data
Generate visualizations
Perform correlation analysis

**Key Findings**
The analysis reveals a moderate negative correlation (-0.56) between time on page and revenue
Visualizations help identify patterns and distributions in the data
The project demonstrates basic data analysis techniques that can be applied to similar datasets
